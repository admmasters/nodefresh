# nodefresh

Simple cli tool to delete node modules from your hard drive.
This would be useful for those who end up with hard drives full
of old node_modules.

# Usage:

```
nodefresh [rootdir]
```

# Future plans:

Going forward this is something that could more intelligently delete
node_modules, such as determining whether a directory is active or
not.
